// Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperature of the water.


// Q = waterMass ( finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature ) x 4184
// waterMass is water weight in kilograms
// finalTemperature and initialTemperature are temperatures in Celsius
// Q is the results in Joules


// Step 1: Prompt the User to enter amount of water in kilograms(watermass)

// Step 2: Prompt the User to enter initial temp. of the water

// Step 3: Prompt the User to enter the final temp. of the water

// Step 4: Calculate 
// Q = watermass(kg) ( finalTemperature - initialTemperature ) * 4184

// Step 5: Give the output of the calculation 

// Step 6: Exit the program
